    <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
    <p>The constant movement, quick passes and skilful dribbling create a thrilling and dynamic atmosphere. Additionally, the unpredictability of football adds to its excitement. Goals can be scored at any moment, and the outcome of a match can change in an instant like Ronaldo bicycle kick, Messi dribbling getting pass through 3 to 4 opponents.</p>
    <h3>How To Get Started</h3>
    <ul></ul>
        <li>Movement - Moving around the pitch at different speeds.</li>
        <li>Control - Basic ball control whether stationary or on the move.</li>
        <li>Passing - Learning how and when to pass the ball to a teammate.</li>
        <li>Shooting - Striking the ball is what leads to goals and who doesn't love scoring?</li>
    </ul>
